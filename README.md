This was a development package that fitted a random walk with time-varying move persistence (autocorrelation) to single or multiple individual animal tracks. Move persistence (gamma_t) is a latent variable that is estimated as a simple random walk through time. The models are fitted using maximum likelihood estimation via the `TMB` ([Template Model Builder](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp)) package and using C++. Whether the input data are for a single or multiple individuals, the model is fit to each individual track separately.
